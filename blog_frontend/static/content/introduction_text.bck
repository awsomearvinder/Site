Now that we got that out of the way, nice to meet you! I'm Arvinder, and I'm a 17 year old programmer as well as an aspiring linux system administrator. My laptop currently runs arch and I'm working on my way towards getting my RHCSA. 

The programming language I enjoy using the most is Rust, and I have interests in lower level programming, although as of yet I haven't done much of that if any. If you want to see my projects, check out my Projects page or my github! Be warned though, I tend to skimp a bit on code quality near the final push. 
    
In school I enjoy topics like math and physics. I'm definetly into the whole STEM thing. Outside of school I happen to be the local tech geek. I practically live on discord and it's where I probably spend the majority of my unproductive days. If you want to message me, come drop in! I'm John Benber#9856, (also join <a href="https://www.discord.gg/pcParadise"> Pcparadise</a>), and it'd be a pleasure to have a chat with you!
