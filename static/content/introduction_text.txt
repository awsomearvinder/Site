<br \>&emsp; Guess I'll give it a shot anyways though. Nice to meet you! I'm Arvinder, an aspiring software developer currently in highschool. I primarily deal with Rust, although I can get by with most languages. I enjoy working with linux systems, and am currently working towards getting my RHCSA. I enjoy math, and although I don't game often, I want to get back into it. I've always wanted to play an MMORPG, although I've never really delved into them.
<br /><br />&emsp; On another side note, this site was created to host my blog moreso then anything else, so if you want to see how I like to work and learn, go check it out!
